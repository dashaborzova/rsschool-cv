## About Me

====
I've been working as a teacher for 10 years and when I have free time I devote it to developing new skills such as programming. I get very excited when my code works.

## Skills

====

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScrips(Basic)
- Figma

## Code Example

====

```
**Create a function which answers to the question "Are you playing banjo?"
If your name starts with letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!
The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:
name + " plays banjo"
name + " does not play banjo"**
```

```
function areYouPlayingBanjo(name){
if(name.startsWith('R')|| name.startsWith('r')){
return name + ' plays banjo';
}
return name + ' does not play banjo';
}
```
