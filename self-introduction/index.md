Hello! 

My name is Daria. I’m 36.  I live in Moscow this is my hometown. 

Professional background:

I have a lot of experience working in different spheres. I started at the age of 14 in a fast-food restaurant, then a database operator in a production company, I was promoted to a specialist in accounting. This was a position where I understood that I need to get a second higher education in linguistics. I combined studying with working as an import manager. After graduation, I got a job as a teacher in a state school. Where I realized that I was stuck. I’m a constant learner by nature and there wasn’t any opportunity for development.

Motivation to study programming:

One day I saw an ad of school 21 and applied. I sank If you know what I mean but it gave me such a boost  of energy and enthusiasm, so I went on practising.  
I took a chance at Learn.javascript, FreeCodeCamp, Geekbrains but  I made a huge mistake as many beginners do by spending a lot of time in the research from multiple resources instead of writing the code.
Fortunately, I believe I found the right way. The well-organized schedule in RS School, gamification of learning and ability to look through open-source materials whenever you want helps me a lot in reaching my goal.

I believe that there are no limits to what you can get or unsolvable problems. There can be a lack of time or your desire or you just need to look at the problem from the different point of view.

Thank you for your attention!
